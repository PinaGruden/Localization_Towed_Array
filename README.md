# Localization Towed Array
 
 This repo contains code for the localization with ambiguity surfaces for towed array data.
 
 It is developed with Matlab version 2022a. (if using older versions commands clim and FOntSize for plotting do not exist)
 
 ## How to use
 
 1. Use *towedarray_LS_Simulations.m* for Simulation scenarios. Available simulations:
 
- Simulation 1: Stationary source, moving array, no noise on measurements

- Simulation 2: Stationary source, moving array, noisy measurements 

- Simulation 3: Moving source, moving array, no noise on measurements - Incorporates Dilation of Surfaces

- Simulation 4: Moving source, moving array with more sensors, no noise on measurements

- Simulation 5: Two stationary sources, moving array, no noise

2. Use *towedarray_LS_RealDataexample.m* for real data example.
